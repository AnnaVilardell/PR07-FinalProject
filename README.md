## Project Description and Workflow


### Description

This project is to apply Machine Learning in a real project.

**Dataset**

The dataset chosen is data of +40k student from IH.

**Metadata**
 
    - bootcamp_course: course associated to the opportunity, either WD, UX or DA.
    - bootcamp_format: format associated to the opportunity, either FT or PT.
    - bootcamp_start_date: Start Date of the course associated to thez opportunity.
    - stage: The stage name the application lives at that moment.
    - lost_deal_reason: Reason why the applicant has dropped the admission process
    - stage_before_lost: The stage where the opportunity is before getting lost
    - created_date: Date and time when this record was created.
    - close_date: Date when the opportunity is expected to close (before closing) or closed.
    - drop_reason: Reason why the applicant has dropped after paying his deposit
    - net_amount: Amount minus Discount or Scholarship Amount
    - discount_type: Type of the discount, either Scholarship or Discount
    - discount_name: Name of the discount initiative associated to the opportunity
    - discount_amount: Amount of the discount that the applicant received
    - scholarship_name: Name of the scholarship initiative associated to the opportunity
    - scholarship_amount: Amount of the scholarship discount given to the opportunity
    - financing_options: name of the financing option
    - financing_option_amount: amount in local currency of the financing option
    - deposit_payment: The amount of the tuition neither the student or Ironhack paid
    - Stage Duration: The number of days the opportunity was in the stage listed in the Stage column
    - ...


**Goal**

Classify if a potential student is going to enrol or not to a school. *What if it would be possible to predict if a potential student will enrol to IH?*  *What if we could understand his/her journey to enrol?*
 
 The main objectives will be:
   1. Know better funnel trends, to dedicate +/- resources to â‰  prospects and stages
   2. Recognize better our target, to give insights to marketing
   3. Predict better BSt, and so our revenue




### Workflow

1. Environment

2. Data Preparation

    2.1 EDA
    
    2.2 Data Wrangling
    
        - Explore Data
        - Clean Data
        - Remove usless columns
        - Creat new columns
    
    2.3 Feature Selection  
    
        - Feature selection was done togeter and after with the Model      
    
    2.4 Feature Engineering
    
        - Was not needed in this project for the type od data we had
        

3. Select From Model (Classification Models)
        
        - LogisticRegression
        - SVM
        - KNeighborsClassifier
        - DecisionTreeClassifier
        - LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
        - GaussianNB
        - RandomForestClassifier
        - MLPClassifier

4. Train Models (Machine Learning Classification Models)

        - RandomForestClassifier
          - Gridsearch
          - Classifier (with best params)
          - Feature Importance
          - Tree Visualization
   
5. Ensemble Methods

        - XGBoost
          - Gridsearch
          - Classifier (with best params)
          - Feature Importance



## Organization

**Main Organization of the project thought GitHub Project board:**

1. Organize a Project GitHub project board with main tasks and timings
2. Create a repository including a .gitignore file and a Readme.md
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Tuning
6. Write conclusions
7. Prepare presentation
7. Complete Readme.md


**Inside this repository you can find:**
